# Bird-Classification

Hello to all!

This repository contains of 2 scripts. The one is for training the model and the other one for testing the accuracy. It performs data augmentation and transfer learning as I add an
extra layer to the already pretained ResNet 34. 

In my PC the folders that have the images are located at the same location with the scripts. In case you want to run the scripts and you have the folders in a location, please take 
it into account and change the path!

Thank you
