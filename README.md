# Bird-Classification

Hello to all!

This branch compared to the main contains of ensemble learning and that's why a new branch was created.

This branch contains of 2 scripts. The one is for training the model and the other one for testing the accuracy. It performs data augmentation,transfer learning and ensemble 
learning as I add an extra layer to the already pretained ResNet 34 and ResNet 18. 

In my PC the folders that have the images are located at the same location with the scripts. In case you want to run the scripts and you have the folders in a location, please take 
it into account and change the path!

Thank you
